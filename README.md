### Magisk Module to enable NR-SA on AT&T SIM cards and on AT&T's PLMN
ASUS disabled NR-SA for AT&T on the Snapdragon Smartphone for Insiders as of the October 2021 OTA. They did so by putting logic into a system framework that checks for AT&T SIM cards or PLMN and subsequentially disables NR-SA. This module restores that functionality.
